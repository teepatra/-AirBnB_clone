This project is deployed to enable us learn more on web application by making a clone the the famous AirBnB website.
The web application design conssit of three major parts, the frontend, backend and database.For this project we will make use of the following

Console as the foundation of the project which provides a straightforward interface and basis for us to integrate with other components. This will be done with the use of cmd module.
For the backend i.e the server side of the project we use OOP Concepts that is classes, oject etc
For the database it will be stored usinf JSON which is the best way to object data using serialization.

Also we will be making use of unittest to test our program.

Learning objectives are

How to create a Python package
How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to serialize and deserialize a Class
How to write and read a JSON file
How to manage datetime
What is an UUID
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

Final product
The final product would look like below images:

"Final Product1"

"Final Product2"

Concepts to learn from doing this project
Unittest - and please work all together on tests cases.
Python packages
Serialization/Deserialization
*args, **kwargs
datetime
how to start and use it
  1. interactive mode: 
  ./console.py
  
  2. non-interactive mode: 
  echo "help" | ./console.py
